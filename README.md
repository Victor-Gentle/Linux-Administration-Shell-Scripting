# DevOps Automation Script README

This script automates the setup of environment, creation of EC2 instances with different AMIs (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, and CentOS), deployment of Apache web server and a sample webpage on the EC2 instances, creation of an S3 bucket, creation of IAM users, and creation of an IAM group. The script is written in shell scripting and highlights the importance of automation in DevOps practices.

## Dependencies
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions
- Bash shell

## Configuration Options
- Modify variables in the script to customize instance type, region, AMI IDs, etc.
- Ensure AWS credentials are configured properly in the environment

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure AWS CLI is properly configured with necessary permissions.
3. Execute the script by running `./aws_configure.sh`.

## Modular Components
- `setup_environment.sh`: Sets up environment variables and configurations.
- `create_ec2_instance.sh`: Creates EC2 instances with different AMIs.
- `deploy_apache.sh`: Deploys Apache web server and sample webpage on the EC2 instances.
- `create_s3_bucket.sh`: Creates an S3 bucket.
- `create_iam_users.sh`: Creates IAM users.
- `create_iam_group.sh`: Creates an IAM group.
- `error_handling.sh`: Implements error handling mechanism for robustness and graceful failure recovery.
- `security_best_practices.sh`: Implements security best practices such as using IAM roles instead of hardcoding credentials.

## Challenges and Recommendations
- Challenge: Ensuring script robustness and handling edge cases.
  Recommendation: Thoroughly test the script in a sandbox environment before production deployment to identify and resolve potential issues.
- Challenge: Managing dependencies and configurations.
  Recommendation: Keep dependencies minimal and clearly document configuration options.
- Challenge: Implementing security best practices.
  Recommendation: Use IAM roles instead of hardcoding credentials for enhanced security.

## Error Handling
- The script implements error handling mechanisms using conditional statements and error messages to ensure robustness and graceful failure recovery.

## Security Best Practices
- IAM roles are used instead of hardcoding credentials for enhanced security.
- AWS resources are provisioned with least privilege access.

## Testing
- Thoroughly test the script in a sandbox environment before production deployment to identify and resolve potential issues.
