# Linux Shell Scripting

This script automates the setup of various components necessary for deploying a web application on AWS EC2 instances. It handles setting up the environment, creating EC2 instances with different Amazon Machine Images (AMI), deploying Apache, creating a sample webpage, setting up an S3 bucket, creating IAM users and groups.

## Requirements

- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
- Linux environment with bash shell.
## Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine.

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions in your AWS account to perform the actions outlined in the script.

- Modify the config.sh file to adjust parameters such as instance type, AMI IDs, IAM usernames, etc., as needed.

## Script Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

- Set Environment: Ensures necessary tools like AWS CLI are installed and environment variables are configured.

- Create EC2 Instances: Creates EC2 instances with different AMIs (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS).

- Deploy Apache and Sample Webpage: Installs Apache server on each EC2 instance and deploys a sample webpage.

- Create S3 Bucket: Creates an S3 bucket for storing static assets.

- Create IAM Users and Group: Creates IAM users and groups for managing AWS access.

## Importance of Linux Shell Scripting in DevOps

Linux shell scripting plays a crucial role in DevOps automation for several reasons:

- Automation: Shell scripts automate repetitive tasks, reducing manual intervention and human error.
- Flexibility: Shell scripts can interact with various system components and APIs, making them versatile for different automation scenarios.
- Integration: Shell scripts can integrate with other tools and technologies, enabling seamless orchestration of complex workflows.
- Efficiency: Shell scripts execute quickly and efficiently, making them ideal for automating deployment pipelines and infrastructure management tasks.

## Challenges and Recommendations
While writing this script, some challenges were encountered:

- AWS Service Integration: Integrating multiple AWS services in a single script requires thorough understanding of each service's APIs and permissions model.
- Error Handling: Ensuring robust error handling and graceful failure recovery mechanisms is crucial for maintaining script reliability.
- Security: Managing credentials securely and implementing least privilege access controls are essential to mitigate security risks.

To address these challenges, follow these recommendations:

- Modularize: Break down the script into modular components for better maintainability and reusability.
Testing: Thoroughly test the script in a sandbox environment before running it in production to identify and resolve potential issues.
Documentation: Document the script thoroughly, including dependencies, configuration options, and usage instructions, to facilitate easier understanding and troubleshooting- Security Best Practices: Follow AWS security best practices, such as using IAM roles instead of hardcoding credentials, and regularly reviewing and updating permissions.
